## About the Project
Questy was made for the [2023 HackAICamp Hackathon](https://hackaicamp.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Upcoming). 
Our idea for the project was to make an AI model that could help student sstudy by creating practice questions given a piece of text from a textbook. 
</br> Hence the name, Questy (Questions + Study). 
</br> The user is also able to control the number of questions that the model outputs. It also outputs the answers to the questions. 

</br>

## Technologies Used

![Tech used](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,pytorch,md,vscode,stackoverflow)

In addition to these cool logos, we also used [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for the UI, and [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to train our model. 

</br>

## Usage + Demo

To try out the model, click [this link](example.com).

(insert screenshot of Gradio here)
The user can input the textbook article or section in the left box, and the AI outputs the questions on the right. The user can also choose the amount of questions that they want generated.
